Artificial Intelligence<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence is a hot topic in the nonprofit sector, and it&#8217;s not hard to see why. As a result, many Salesforce consulting companies are launching AI &amp; Salesforce integrations every day. AI can help with fundraising, engagement and more\u2014and it can be used to make better decisions about how your organization spends its resources. In fact, many nonprofits are already using AI as part of their operations today (for instance: using machine learning algorithms to determine which donors are most likely to give money).<\/p>\n<p>But what does this mean for you? Well&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>AI can help you reach more people\u2014and reach them more efficiently. In fact, one study found that AI could increase your fundraising efficiency by up to 25%. That means for every dollar spent on AI, nonprofits get an additional $1.25 in revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Sales teams \u2013 listen up. The Salesforce nonprofit cloud and the auxiliary tools will help you close deals faster because it helps you predict if a customer is more or less likely to purchase a product with forecasting and lead and opportunity scoring.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, Salesforce for nonprofits will help the Service teams \u2013 no need to feel left out. It\u2019ll help with case classification and routing to increase retention or predict issues. It also includes smart chatbots that make sure you\u2019re engaging with customers and resolving problems effectively.<\/p>\n<p>Salesforce consulting companies, like <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/dtcforce.com\/\">DTC Force<\/a><\/strong>, can help marketing departments to increase conversion rates using engagement scoring and predictive recommendations to predict who is more or less likely to engage with an email.<\/p>\n<p>For both traditional and digital commerce, Salesforce nonprofit cloud uses customer data for targeted advertisements which boosts revenue by predicting if they are more or less likely to purchase a particular item.<\/p>\n<p>With a comprehensive list of 36 features, that can be unlocked at different price points, you get the following features:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.softwareadvice.com\/resources\/salesforce-einstein-ai-primer\/#1\">Machine learning<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.softwareadvice.com\/resources\/salesforce-einstein-ai-primer\/#2\">Natural language processing (NLP)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.softwareadvice.com\/resources\/salesforce-einstein-ai-primer\/#3\">Computer vision<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.softwareadvice.com\/resources\/salesforce-einstein-ai-primer\/#4\">Automatic speech recognition<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>2. Blockchain Technology<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Blockchain is a type of technology that stores information in blocks of data and makes it publicly available. Each block in this chain contains all the previous blocks, meaning you can verify the authenticity of each one. This method makes it much harder for hackers to tamper with or corrupt your data, since every step along the way has been verified by others who are also using blockchain technology.<\/p>\n<p>Blockchain&#8217;s most obvious use case is as a digital ledger for financial transactions (hence why many people think it was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, an individual or group who invented Bitcoin). But blockchain can also be used for other things like tracking supply chains and verifying ownership rights within organizations\u2014and nonprofits have been exploring these applications as well!<\/p>\n<h2><strong>3. Voice Search<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Voice search is a new way to interact with technology. It&#8217;s easier than typing, more natural and accurate than typing and much more efficient than typing.<\/p>\n<p>Voice search will become even more prevalent in 2022 as we continue to see advancements in computer vision systems that can understand what you&#8217;re saying and then perform tasks on your behalf based on what they&#8217;ve learned about your voice patterns or patterns of speech from other people who use similar voices as yours.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>4. Chatbots<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Chatbots are computer programs that interact with users through text, voice and visual displays. They\u2019re often used to answer questions or provide information on a topic. In some cases, they can even perform simple tasks like booking travel reservations or performing online banking transactions (think of them as helpful \u201crobot-ambassadors\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>Chatbots are sometimes referred to as \u201cchatbots-as-a-service\u201d because they offer organizations an opportunity to build a conversational interface that automates routine interactions with customers or clients. This allows Salesforce consulting companies to act strategically for businesses to focus on making more imperative decisions about their brands instead of aligning resources spend time manually responding to customer inquiries every day.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>5. Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Augmented reality and virtual reality are two emerging technologies that can be used to enhance the user experience for nonprofit organizations.<\/p>\n<p>\uf09f\u00a0 Augmented reality (AR) is a blend of real-world and computer generated images that users see through a headset or phone screen as they interact with the digital world. AR applications can be used by nonprofits to create interactive experiences, including ads and games, which engage people in their communities while they learn about issues they care about.<\/p>\n<p>\uf09f\u00a0 Virtual reality (VR) immerses users in environments where they feel as if they&#8217;re actually there\u2014like exploring space or living on another planet\u2014and allows them to experience things in new ways by interacting with objects around them using their hands or controllers such as gloves or gloves-like devices made specifically for VR use.* These technologies have been shown effective at engaging people who may not normally care about an issue but now want more information before deciding if it&#8217;s important enough for them personally.* However, there are challenges associated with implementing these technologies into your organization because:<\/p>\n<h2><strong>6. Micro-moments<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Micro-moments are brief moments that are meaningful. In short, micro-moments are a new way to engage with consumers and increase brand awareness.<\/p>\n<p>Micro-moments can be used by nonprofits as well as any other business, including Fortune 500 companies. Micro-moments include text messages or emails sent out at the right time with just enough information to pique your audience&#8217;s curiosity but not too much information that they would feel overwhelmed or confused by what you&#8217;re offering them.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>7. Data-driven personalized marketing<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Data-driven personalized marketing is a trend that will continue to grow in the next few years. It\u2019s a great way to connect with your customers and can help you find new donors, volunteers, and sponsors. But it\u2019s important to have a strategy in place before you start collecting data on your donors\u2014or else you may end up losing valuable information that could be used later on.<\/p>\n<p>* Make sure you have a plan for how to use the data and how often it will be updated. * Set up alerts so that when someone unsubscribes from your emails, they won\u2019t get anymore unless they re-subscribe. * Make sure your privacy policy is clear about what information you collect from visitors (and where) before asking them to submit any personal details.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>8. Video Marketing<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Video is a great way to engage with your audience and give them a reason to care about what you&#8217;re doing. It can be used to explain how your cause, or even just an aspect of it, works. It&#8217;s also great for telling stories about how you help others\u2014especially if those stories are from the perspective of someone who has been affected by the issue at hand (or even someone who has helped others). And finally, video is an excellent tool for promoting nonprofits in general.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>9. Influencer Marketing<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Influencer marketing is a form of marketing that focuses on the influential people in your target audience. These influencers have large followings on social media, and they have a strong influence on people&#8217;s buying decisions. Influencer marketing is an excellent way to reach your target audience because it gives you access to an already established group of people who can help spread the word about your nonprofit.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>10. Social Media Advertising<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Social media advertising is a great way to reach your target audience and build brand awareness. It\u2019s also a great way to build relationships with your customers, drive sales and grow the impact of your nonprofit.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Pay attention to these trends to get ahead of the competition<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology are hot trends in nonprofit marketing.<\/li>\n<li>Voice search is becoming more popular, with more people using their smartphones to search the web instead of typing out a query on a computer or tablet.<\/li>\n<li>Chatbots can help you get customers who want your brand but don&#8217;t know about it\u2014and they&#8217;re not just for nonprofits anymore!<\/li>\n<li>Augmented reality and virtual reality are on the rise too, giving nonprofits new ways to engage with their audiences through immersive experiences that go beyond traditional advertising strategies like video production or blog posts alone.* Micro-moments, which refers to small moments within larger events such as product launches or conferences, are another way organizations can connect with potential donors while they&#8217;re still thinking about making a donation decision.* Data-driven personalized marketing means creating targeted messages based on customer profiles rather than cookie cutter approaches; this kind of personalization helps organizations target potential supporters based on things like age range, location preferences etcetera &#8211; which means that even if someone doesn&#8217;t donate yet he&#8217;ll likely hear from them again sometime soon when an email campaign goes out about how much money was raised last year by doing X thing.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As a nonprofit, you have a lot of opportunities to get creative with how you use technology (making use of Salesforce for nonprofits) and social media. There are so many new innovations coming out via use of Salesforce consulting companies, but one thing remains constant: people want a good story. They want to feel connected with your organization and learn more about what it does. The best way to do that is by following trends like storytelling practices, podcasting for nonprofits and using video as an opportunity for sharing your mission with donors and supporters.<\/p>\n<p>The future looks bright for nonprofits!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Top 10 nonprofit trends for 2022 The nonprofit world is changing, and it\u2019s changing fast.
