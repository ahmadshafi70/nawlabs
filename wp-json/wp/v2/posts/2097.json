CRM platforms, including <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salesforce<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, have historically had significant capability gaps, forcing manufacturers to create custom solutions on top of their CRM or rely on unconnected data and processes to run their businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Elements of the Manufacturing Cloud\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manufacturing Cloud is built on top of the fundamental features of Salesforce Sales and Service Cloud; therefore, all existing and soon-to-be-released capabilities of the underlying CRM Clouds are included in the solution.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salesforce has stepped up to deliver an industry-aligned platform, building on the current top CRM platform, to align to some of the influential demands for manufacturing firms with Salesforce Manufacturing Cloud. The solution, which began with a number of the most core skills, has expanded. It will continue to be a platform that fulfills manufacturers&#8217; most critical and significant requirements.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Manufacturing Cloud Enhances these Capabilities in the Following Areas:<\/b><\/h2>\n<h3><b>Sales Agreements<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Manufacturing Cloud, Salesforce developed the concepts of &#8220;Sales Agreements&#8221; to meet the requirement for firms to track and manage business known as &#8220;Run-rate,&#8221; which is frequently at the heart of manufacturing organizations&#8217; revenue and operations. Clients or partners have committed to buying a specified amount of merchandise over a set time period in a run-rate business model. Although the formality of these agreements varies, in most cases, the idea is for manufacturers to create a baseline expectation for future orders that they can assess and monitor during the contract.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Organizations can use Sales Agreements in Manufacturing Cloud to:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manage the agreement lifecycle, which includes collaborating with clients on new agreement volumes and price, current contract revisions, and agreement renewal and expansion for the following period.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key agreement metrics, such as planned and actual volumes, product pricing and margins, as well as unique metrics that can be generated to fit particular demands, should all be measured.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Convert acquired new business possibilities into sales agreements, or create arrangements apart from the new business pipeline.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>Account-based Forecasting<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forecasting for run-rate business should incorporate both current scheduled business for a specific account over time and future business prospects for that same account. Other elements, such as past order trends and real-time market and consumer information, should be considered when making a budget estimate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Organizations can use Manufacturing Cloud&#8217;s Account-based Forecasting to:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capture a sales estimate for new and run-rate businesses, including expected volumes and income sources.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Develop and fine-tune commercial projections existing sales, and new business pipeline that may function as the source of validity&#8217; for downstream supply chain and production planning by collaborating across sales, finance, and operations.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reduce the time sales or account managers spend developing and monitoring predictions by leveraging data to provide forecast ideas.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help operations without burdening sales teams, disaggregate projections to SKU levels.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>Manufacturing Analytics<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, any CRM is only as valuable as the information it provides.

Some of the key capabilities include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>OmniScripts: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">offer a guided route for customers\/partners\/employees to complete a specific business process, including logic branching and responsive design for mobile apps.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>FlexCards:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> give access to appropriate tasks for the provided data and display contextual information at a glance.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Together with other new process capabilities, these features will enable businesses to digitize operations that span organizational borders and beyond easily.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Rebate Management<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salesforce has developed <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/news\/stories\/rebate-management\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rebate Management<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a service designed to fulfill the requirements of companies that need to plan, execute, and target cash payback incentives for their channel partners. Organizations can use Rebate Management to create incentive programs in Salesforce that can be shared with channel partners, complete with up-to-date performance data for each program. Rebate management helps enterprises ease the time-consuming administering incentive programs by building on Manufacturing Cloud. Much of the essential data to check eligibility and incentive program attainment already exists.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Enhance your Service Forecasting Accuracy<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salesforce is extending its Manufacturing Cloud forecasting platform, which is currently used to estimate run-rate business, to manage aftermarket service demand. Service Forecasting may assist firms in projecting demand for specific components and field service specialists by using critical data points such as past repair orders, standardized format, and installed assets.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Customers&#8217; Voices Should Be Heard More Often<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Salesforce Feedback Management integrated into Manufacturing Cloud, businesses will elicit and evaluate feedback from customers and partners at crucial touchpoints. Organizations may elevate and incorporate customer feedback into everyday customer and partner interactions by connecting surveys with current commercial processes.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Not Solely for Manufacturers<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a product is given a name, it piques the primary target audience&#8217;s interest and demand. Yet, on the other hand, it may cause other potential users to dismiss it as a viable option for their company. Other companies, such as wholesalers, high tech, retail, and so on, may also benefit from Manufacturing Cloud&#8217;s characteristics. If your organization has a &#8216;run-rate&#8217; component, you need to anticipate your ongoing book of business, or you need to monitor and calculate refunds; Manufacturing Cloud is worth investigating further.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What Exactly is Salesforce Manufacturing Cloud?
