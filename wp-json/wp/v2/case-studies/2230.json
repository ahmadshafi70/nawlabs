They offer a range of services from construction to facility management.<\/p>\n<h5>Problem<\/h5>\n<p>SiteWorks grew as big as it could on Microsoft Outlook and Excel, and was struggling to transition from a consumer-focused organization to a business-focused one with no CRM system in place. Siteworks required a streamlined, central system to automate their organizational, repetitive and reporting tasks. They were spending long hours coordinating construction jobs and potential contractors manually.<\/p>\n<h5>DTC Force\u2019s Solution<\/h5>\n<p>As usual, we started our process with a series of discovery sessions by our business analysts to understand their business and its requirements. A customization of Salesforce was in order, including creating Partner and Customer Communities, which allowed the customers themselves to upload their Pending Work Orders, complete with requirements, start dates, pictures, contact details and locations.<\/p>\n<p>The Partners would then automatically receive the Work Orders depending on their capabilities and locations, and could upload proposals and bids. Following a successful match, invoices and reports would be automatically created, while Salesforce Maps was used to introduce a visual map of all ongoing, pending work orders and contractor locations in a single view.<\/p>\n<p>We trained Siteworks on best Salesforce practices so they could become self-sufficient and grow the systems as they go along. Together, we defined key metrics needed to be tracked to quickly generate reports and dashboards to view their progress and efficiency.<\/p>\n<h5>Results<\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>SiteWorks is now an automated matchmaker between jobs and contractors, instead of a manual coordinator.<\/li>\n<li>Siteworks no longer needs to use 20+ applications and files to manage different aspects of their business.<\/li>\n<li>Siteworks is actively able to use their time to find more significant leads now that their process is automated.<\/li>\n<li>Siteworks is actively using Salesforce customized to fit their business needs.<\/li>\n<li>Siteworks is getting more business than ever, thanks to their automated Work order System.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After our
