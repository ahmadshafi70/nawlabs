				<h2><strong>Streamline your automation with Salesforce Flow</strong></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most awaited feature of Salesforce, premiered this Spring, allowing users to automate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce Flow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by simply pointing and clicking away. There are many beneficial reasons, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">business automation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> functions, for switching to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce Flow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This feature for automation enables you to achieve high efficiency via </span><span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://dtcforce.com/fsl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>field service automation</strong></span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and enables </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing automation solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within your organization which helps you save time, obtained through complete</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Salesforce automation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for more strategic projects. Whether you are learning how to be an expert, or are simply just starting, it can be challenging to understand the expansiveness of a tool like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce Flow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is everything you need to know about building high-quality Flows.</span></p><h2><b>About Salesforce Flow </b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The questions for most beginners would be what exactly is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce Flow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and how does it enhance the existing operating system for </span><a href="https://dtcforce.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>business automation</strong></span></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? This is a game-changing feature because your organization’s developers can automate with a click instead of writing long codes. This simple tool offers a lot of complexity as you would have full control over the order of execution, method of automation, and from what records; thus enabling full-scale </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">field service automation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you can automate your work and make quick changes with just a click. This removes any need for the upkeep of complex codes that always require platform knowledge.</span></p><h2><b>The transition from salesforce workflow rules and process builder</b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is no news that Salesforce is moving away from Process Builder and Workflow Rules and recommending all its users to start getting oriented with Flow so it is a rather smoother transition. While this shift may seem massive for a few organizations, there is a lot that they gain during this transitionary period in terms of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">business automation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">field service automation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://dtcforce.com/salesforce-marketing-cloud/">marketing automation solution</a></span></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We will get into the specifics of this move below.</span></p><p> </p><h3><b>Using salesforce flow within your organization</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The switch can especially feel difficult if your current system is working just fine, and you think that your organization has achieved the optimum </span><strong><a href="https://dtcforce.com/"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Salesforce automation</span></a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That might make you think why you should even be considering moving to Flow. That is a fair question as transitioning requires a lot of time and effort and you are right in evaluating whether it is even worth it. The answer to your concerns is that moving to Flow is worth it because it would significantly reduce your technical debt, provide a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing automation solution,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and enable </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce automation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in its truest sense. After all, the earlier mechanisms are retiring. There is more to motivate you towards Flow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest and yet the most basic benefit of moving towards Flow is its interface. Flow’s interface consists of features that let you begin with a blank canvas; it will be easier to achieve </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">business automation </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">every day as it will give you all the tools that are required on a day-to-day basis. Not only that, but because of Flow’s unique characteristics, you do not have to be worried about the overlap between different tools, as this new addition simplifies everything; thus enabling exemplified </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">field service automation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the current functionality, Process Builder and Workflows offer you a limited set of things that can be done that do not enable </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce automation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in its truest sense. For example, right now you are only allowed to update and create records of just a single object type. Meaning that the process builder for contact can only create and update the respective contact’s data. Therefore, we generally believe that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce Flow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a much more expansive addition. With Flow, you can access, manipulate, and manage any set of records, from multiple arrays of events that reside within the instance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the Flows that would help you streamline your respective </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">business automation </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">processes.</span></p><p><a href="https://dtcforce.com/appointment/"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2964 size-full" src="https://dtcforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Learn-More-About-Sales-For-Services-01-01.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="565" srcset="https://dtcforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Learn-More-About-Sales-For-Services-01-01.jpg 1920w, https://dtcforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Learn-More-About-Sales-For-Services-01-01-300x88.jpg 300w, https://dtcforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Learn-More-About-Sales-For-Services-01-01-1024x301.jpg 1024w, https://dtcforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Learn-More-About-Sales-For-Services-01-01-768x226.jpg 768w, https://dtcforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Learn-More-About-Sales-For-Services-01-01-1536x452.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first one is Before Save Flow, which helps you with automatically checking a series of child records before you have begun to update the parent. Through this, you could also check for any open opportunities before you even identify an account to be completely inactive.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second one is the After Delete Flows. It helps you act on the records even after you have deleted them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third includes are Subflow and Flow Orchestrator. These two help you connect two different pieces of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">business automation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> information, by firing one after the next.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fourth Flow is Point and Click Flow. Instead of depending on custom triggers, you can use this function for setting records for an update once a week or even once every day. You can also set it to be at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, we have Screen Flow. It helps your users to be well oriented through different screens when they are adding new data into the system. Let’s now think about a case where this would be used. While recruiting someone new and they are signing up for the training for the specific role. You can set up an interface that takes the applicant through a list of questions. It will also see whether the data provided by the applicant is already part of the system or if it must be a new entry. The system will then check all the records and generate an email that will confirm their participation in the program. All such tasks are possible with this Flow option. The variety of operational flexibilities allowed by these additions enables a different level of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://dtcforce.com/salesforce-marketing-cloud/">marketing automation solution</a></span></strong>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thus empowering cross-functional </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">field service automation,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thus allowing maximum benefit through </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce automation.</span></p><h3><b>Upgrade your automation</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best thing about </span><span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://dtcforce.com/salesforce-service-cloud/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Salesforce Flow</strong></span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the way it is extremely simple to use, and how easy it makes streamlining </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">business automation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Previously, to achieve this level of sophistication in your system, one had to go through multiple sequences. What previously used to be done in three steps can now just be performed with one Flow. This simply means that one Flow can contain the complexity of performing multiple Flows at once. Not only does this translate into less maintenance for achieving </span><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://dtcforce.com/">Salesforce automation</a></span></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but also it invites you to a more user-friendly representation of what is happening.</span></p><h3><b>Salesforce workflow rules</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If as an organization you decide to adopt Flow, you will have more control over your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">business automation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and when it should be triggered. This brings a greater sense of control over the records and what you can do with them. As a result, you can have a better communication system, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">field service automation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and opportunities for establishing streamlined processes.</span></p><h3><b>Making most out of salesforce flow</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the looks of it, it may seem that the opportunities </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce Flow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> brings are endless, but there is still a reasonable amount of caution that every organisation using such a feature should take. Successful; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing automation solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and improved usage of features rely on how well your Flow is built. If it is a poorly constructed Flow, your basic operations can be full of errors and issues. To keep your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce automation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> full proof, use these ways to have the best experience.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number one thing to consider should be using best-practice patterns. What this tells you is that you may not be proficient in thinking like a developer, but you should know how to consider bulkification whenever possible. This asks you to change your normal way of thinking which automatically concludes that if X happens Y will happen. Instead, the thinking should be if X happens, what will happen to everything connected to X. several resources can help you understand and practice this rationale in detail. It is highly recommended to get a grip on this to create a solid foundation for your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce automation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second thing that should be on your to-do list is to update your playbook. Since there are a few </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce automation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rules that are being revised, and recommendations are always evolving, as an organization, you need to take into account all such changes. For example, previously, the recommendation was just to have a single type of automation on an object. However, that was very hard and made things a lot more complex. With </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce Flow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this is not the case anymore.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third and the very last thing that you need to consider having a pleasant experience with Flow is that before starting, you should evaluate the needs for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">business automation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of your organization. Since it is one robust tool, it is even more crucial to know what type of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">field service automation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing automation solution</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is required for the impact your organization is aiming for. This helps in anticipating barriers or challenges. Since </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce Flow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does offer you plenty of options for customization, it is now ever more important to know what you want so you can find the right fit that helps your organization to be more successful.</span></p><h3><b>Moving existing automation</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is also a very valid concern. If your organization has existing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce automation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made through the Process Builder, you do not have to worry about losing all the existing functionalities that you have been using, as Salesforce Flow is just a more elegant version of what you already have. The Flow will also have a tool that will help you migrate your existing </span><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://dtcforce.com/fsl/">field service automation</a></span></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But, if you have automation for a single object built on each of the tools, then you will most probably need to have new flows that are all in one place. This can become incredibly challenging for administrators as it creates obstacles in further development so that you might have some technical debt.</span></p><h3><b>Developing strategic initiatives</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the right analysis based on your existing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">salesforce automation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help you in avoiding any technical debt. Such strategic decisions will support you in creating a good foundation for practising reliable automation. Once that is out of the way, you will notice that as an organization you are focusing more on taking strategic decisions as opposed to building back the automation that is broken.</span></p>					</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email is dead. Slack did to email, what email did to physical mail—at least in the business world. The pandemic put some nails in that coffin when it forced most businesses to move their offices to the cloud.  </span></p>
<p><b>This 10-minute read will give you:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An overview of what Slack is, and why it’s as exciting as it is.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>10 reasons</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> why your business can benefit from the Salesforce Slack synergy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>7 tangible benefits</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that integrating Slack with Salesforce will bring for you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confidence that Slack can handle your business case perfectly. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>What is Slack?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve seen the slogans: ‘Slack is where work happens’; ‘Slack is where the future works’. It simplifies and streamlines the foundation of every single business in the world—communication. It’s the heart and brain of the workplace, a digital HQ for all messaging, tools and files. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that it? Just a messenger for direct messaging and group chats? Why was </span><a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/blog/news/salesforce-completes-acquisition-of-slack"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slack bought for $27.7bn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Is a sleek, intuitive UI with a vibrant color scheme and emojis everywhere really worth that much?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe, maybe not—but having something that Microsoft, Apple, IBM or Sun didn’t have—could be worth that much. None of the older players in the market had anything comparable, in functionality, in design and in general, really.</span></p>
<h2><b>Salesforce Slack Combo: The #1 CRM &amp; #1 Digital HQ combined</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce lets your marketing, sales, commerce, service, IT and other miscellaneous teams work together from anywhere—it’s already the best solution to create a single source of truth for your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, integrating Slack adds a single platform to inter-connect everyone and communicate effectively—not just be managed from above by you in the CRM. Let’s see why companies like </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21132060/ibm-slack-chat-employee-rollout-microsoft-teams-competition"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IBM choose to use Slack instead of something like Microsoft Teams, for all of their 350 thousand employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><b>10 Reasons To Integrate Slack and Salesforce</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resulting ecosystem creates the most modern workplace possible, creating a community and effective collaboration in teams that could be scattered all over the world. So, what are the benefits?</span></p>
<h3><b>1. Slack and Service Cloud connect seamlessly</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Salesforce for Slack app supports custom objects in both Sales &amp; Service clouds. A quick &#8216;/salesforce&#8217; search allows quick browsing of all Salesforce objects, both standard and custom, without flicking and clicking back and forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The employees are connected right to the brain—right from the app that they will use to communicate what they’ve just found out. </span></p>
<h3><b>2. Simplify the working day</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumping between systems and trying to share records across, copy, paste—all that clicking adds up. Lack of integration steals productivity, few seconds at a time, as well as being annoying in its repetitive and sub-optimal nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to access the whole Salesforce brain right from Slack commands liberates that productivity, a few seconds at a time. With time, accessing and sharing Salesforce records is second nature. </span></p>
<h3><b>3. Slack Salesforce back—the two way street </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works the other way, too. Slack conversations can be attached to a Salesforce record, so any significant developments or important conversations can be viewed along with every account in Salesforce. No need for sending status updates by email or otherwise, it&#8217;s already there-and never gets lost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instant integration of Slack with Salesforce allows for faster queries and collaboration in reference to existing Salesforce entries, and then, when the case is solved, updating the Salesforce record afterwards.</span></p>
<h3><b>4. Reduce email use</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emails are too formal for today’s dynamic work environment. Leave email to the stiffs in corporations that pretend to work more than they actually work. Skip the feigned politeness, and get right to the point of what needs to be done with a quick message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, those seconds and minutes add up. ‘Quick questions’ become really quick. An issue that needs to be elevated to a higher level doesn’t have to be an email starting and ending with needless formalities. It doesn’t get lost between the Whole Foods newsletter and your UberEats receipt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole conversation history is instantly available, instead of 30 different chains of forwarded, CC’d and replies to emails. </span></p>
<h3><b>5. Push notifications, instead of pushing paper</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fast push notification with the gist of the message will appear across any device your addressee uses Slack on. Images, attachments—just like any other social media. By moving workplace communication closer towards the informal model of social media—engagement grows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instinctive modern nature of endless chatting, constant notifications and conversation threads is captured entirely by Slack, and using it is already second nature to the employees in your teams. And now it’s integrated right into Salesforce—The distance between the brain of the company and the employee is cut down more than ever before.</span></p>
<h3><b>6. Easy and fast file access</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fast and permanent nature of sending files with Slack makes it easy to share with some or all teammates, and makes it easy if you need to come back and refer to it again. If you shared it once, there is no need to ever send it again—just @ the new recipient—done.  </span></p>
<h3><b>7. Increase interconnectedness while controlling access levels</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to split all workflows and teams into channels allows for building a multiverse of custom approaches to specific situations. Channels could be allocated to a task, a team, a category, or any other criteria. Channels can be public or private, making access levels easy to manage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are no needs for separate email threads with different combinations of colleagues. A channel will handle that from now, forever. Those discussions can be further organized into threads, so that the overall chat view isn&#8217;t cluttered. Users can follow or unfollow threads to stay up-to-date with new events, or to de-clutter their communication stream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce Slack integration allows for attaching any conversation instantly to a Salesforce record, allowing issues to be resolved efficiently and with haste.</span></p>
<h3><b>8. Automate, automate, automate</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slack has the ability to build customized bots to converse and service through the chat feature. What’s more, the robots can be set to submit automatic updates, monitor metrics such as expenditure, and find issues and inconsistencies automatically. Apart from a million other things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Salesforce and Slack combo can benefit greatly—a customer or a fresh hire can work with a bot to try and find a common solution—the details of which are automatically attached to your Salesforce records. Salesforce’s AI platform Einstein can intelligently troubleshoot and forward cases.</span></p>
<h3><b>9. Building workflow approvals </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approvals for all kinds of matters: holiday time, expenses, as well as all kinds of operations and projects—are now built in Slack and automatically updated in the Salesforce Record. Just another process simplified and streamlined by Slack and Salesforce integration.</span></p>
<h3><b>10. Quote management </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you send a big proposal, you may end up on the edge of your seat, checking over and over if it has been approved or needs amendments. Now, it comes automatically to your Slack inbox—if it’s not there, nothing has happened yet—no need to waste time checking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the Slack Salesforce integration, after receiving these alerts, you can right away respond, and update the relevant CRM records to reflect the new situation.</span></p>

<h2><b>5 Benefits of Slack Salesforce Integration for Your Company</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That seems like a lot of features, optimizations, and corners cut. But what does it mean for your company at large? What are the actually tangible benefits of using this solution?</span></p>
<h3><b>1. Salesforce and Slack increases real-time collaboration among employees</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community and camaraderie organically sprout when a progress update can be confirmed with an emoji, or when everyone is on home office and someone shares a picture of their cat sitting on their keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slack relaxes the atmosphere. At the same time, it’s still connected to the Salesforce brain. Work seems more intuitive and fun, and collaboration is easier, faster and more productive. Pieces gel, and cogs become oiled when Slack is working.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Slack and Salesforce increase flexibility dramatically</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the work is ready and at the fingertips at all times. Launching up Slack is all you need to do. That gives the employees the flexibility to work how they work best—in their own way or time. By giving more leeway to the employees, productivity and effectiveness increase. </span></p>
<h3><b>3. As Salesforce and Slack increase productivity, customer satisfaction does too</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increased engagement and ease of work for your employees translates directly to an improved customer experience. The well-gelled team is quicker in responding to customer queries, they access better information faster and can respond to customers appropriately.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The issues and cases are solved and closed promptly, the waits are short, and the atmosphere is less stiff and more welcoming.</span></p>
<h3><b>4. Reduce unnecessary work—Salesforce and Slack integration simply saves money</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All those seconds add up. If in a company of 1,000, every employee saved </span><b>1 MINUTE every working day for a year</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 4350 hours are saved. You can multiply that by the average rate at your company yourself. You can imagine the benefits </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-slack-partnership-customer-digital-transformation-2020-2?r=US&amp;IR=T"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IBM is getting by rolling out Slack to 350,000 employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>5. The saved time can be productively spent </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the example 4350 hours is just a saving. That time can now be allocated more fruitfully. What can your company do with 4350 hours? How many leads can you chase up, how many sales can you close? How many projects can be completed in that time?</span></p>
<h2><b>How integrating Slack and Salesforce usually works</b></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DTCForce is constantly tasked with making sure the Slack Salesforce instance works perfectly and seamlessly—after all, most of our clients use it now. We create the connections and objects exactly to the customers’ brief using the Slack API.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We usually configure a basic VF page to construct an authentication page, so a new user can register and configure their instance in the Slack channel. Then the work moves onto synchronizing Contacts, Tasks, and other objects, and sharing them amongst the specific Slack channels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After making sure all fields link and work seamlessly and can be accessed by the users with the right permissions, the Slack Salesforce integration is set up to maximize the potential of your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a quick job and a negligible cost for the sheer amount and volume of benefits it brings.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time is money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And timing is everything when it comes to making sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But did you know there are tons of ways to avoid wasting time, especially for your sales reps? A McKinsey report shows that more than 40% of workers spend at least one-fourth of their workweek emailing, collecting, and entering data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reduces their time reaching out to customers, and it’s a major productivity killer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business efficiency is the top mandate, and any company that wants to increase the bottom line is jumping on board the digital transformation bandwagon. However, successful transformation initiatives are those that are carefully thought out, communicated well, and address a recurring problem you’re currently facing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good starting point is to improve the processes in place first before introducing radical measures that do more harm than good. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter Outlook integration with Salesforce – a one-of-a-kind suite of products that enables sales reps to work through Outlook and simultaneously update their salesforce data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most organizations are already communicating internally and externally using Outlook and staying organized, but Salesforce integration tunes your system like a well-oiled machine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It gives sales reps the ability to log emails and events to Salesforce records. Adding the Einstein Activity Capture automates emails and events while syncing contacts and calendar events between Salesforce and Outlook.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell &#8212; sales reps sell more, worry less.</span></p>
